# Open-Loop Reinforcement Learning

This is the official repository to the paper "A Pontryagin Perspective on Reinforcement Learning" by Onno Eberhard, Claire Vernade and Michael Muehlebach (2024).
All algorithms discussed in the paper are included here.

## Installation
```
pip install git+https://github.com/onnoeberhard/pontryagin
```

## Examples
Once installed, you can run the examples in the `examples` folder, e.g.
```
python examples/pendulum.py
``` 
On first run it might take a few minutes. If it hangs after the plot shows, try to change the file to have `plot=False` in the function call.
